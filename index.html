            <p>Friends, we're hearing headlines like "1,000+ people missing" in Delhi. That immediately sounds like a kidnapping epidemic.</p>
            <p>But here are the questions we must ask:</p>

            <!-- Bulletin Box -->
            <div class="bullet-box">
                <ol>
                    <li>Is this actually a sudden surge in missing persons, or are we reacting to a broad category without understanding what is inside it?</li>
                    <li>What does "missing" actually mean? Because "missing" is a reporting category. It includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teenagers who ran away from home after fighting with their parents</li>
                            <li>Teenagers escaping abusive homes</li>
                            <li>Those who have left because of family pressure</li>
                            <li>Youngsters who eloped without telling their families</li>
                            <li><span class="orange-point">Children or individuals abducted by criminals or traffickers</span></li>
                            <li>Elderly individuals with Alzheimer’s or dementia who lose their way</li>
                
                        </ul>
            etc.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>All of that is thrown under one word: missing.</p>
            <!-- Important Note -->
            <p class="important-note">
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> Regardless of the reasons why someone is reported missing, human trafficking is a very real and serious problem in India. We must remain vigilant and ensure that child traffickers and other criminals are caught and punished. At the same time, we should avoid reacting only to sensational headlines that may exaggerate or distort the reality of the situation. This article aims to encourage both caution and critical thinking.
            </p>

            <p>  And when the government says "child," remember that legally it includes anyone under 18. A 17-year-old who runs away with her boyfriend is counted as missing in the same category as a 6-year-old abducted from the street by a child trafficker. Those are not the same situations. But the headline does not tell you that. It just vaguely says "missing". Because "missing" is not the same as "kidnapped or trafficked".</p>

            <h2 class="sub-title">Panic, Perception, and Political Motives</h2>

            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img src="images/news img 1.jpg" alt="Slide 2 Image">
            </div>

            <p>I want to ask: has there actually been a statistical spike in human trafficking in Delhi far beyond historical yearly patterns?</p>
            <p>Or are routine reporting figures being dramatized, especially at a time when a film about child trafficking is being released?</p>
            <p>Or is it possible that some people, frustrated with slow action against real trafficking networks, are amplifying this viral narrative to force urgency?</p>
            <p>Consider the recent waterway incident in Uttar Pradesh, which occurred just days ago, where a woman falsely claimed that a child had fallen into a garbage-filled drain. Authorities rushed to the scene, cleaned the entire drain, and conducted an urgent search. She later admitted it was a lie. This incident illustrates how a single alarming report, even if untrue, can prompt immediate action and widespread concern, much like how out-of-context headlines about missing persons can cause officials to respond hastily.</p>

            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img src="images/merut drain cleaned.jpeg" alt="Waterway Incident Image">
            </div>

            <p>Some people praised her, saying, "At least the garbage got cleaned, and it proves that the officials are capable of clearing it when they believe a child is in danger."</p>
            <p>Others criticized her, warning that repeated false alarms weaken trust. Like the story of the boy who cried "tiger" again and again when there was no tiger, and when a real tiger finally appeared, no one came to help him.</p>
            <p>That is the danger of panic without context. It may create action once, but it can destroy credibility the next time it truly matters.</p>

        <!-- Slide 3 -->
        <section class="slide">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Responsibility and Critical Thinking</h2>

            <p>Let me be clear about one thing:</p>
            <p>If a child is abducted, that is a grave crime.</p>
            <p>The trafficking networks must be identified and punished severely.</p>
            <p>But we cannot automatically treat every "missing person" statistic as human trafficking.</p>
            <p>Until the news separates voluntary runaways, domestic escape cases, elopements, and confirmed abductions into distinct categories, the headline alone tells us nothing.</p>
            <p>Some news channels have even reported that the number of missing persons has recently decreased in Delhi, though it is hard to know how accurate that is, since each outlet seems to interpret or highlight the data in ways that suit their narrative. I will leave it to you to decide what you want to believe.</p>
            <p>It is not our burden as citizens to dig through government websites and analyze all the data ourselves. News channels and media outlets should do that. Unfortunately, they often do not and instead give us vague, emotionally loaded headlines, forcing us to spend time we could otherwise use on more important tasks.</p>
            <p>If anyone wants to explore the real data themselves, for example from the National Crime Records Bureau, to analyze patterns and form their own conclusions, they are welcome to do so. I personally do not have time for that statistical work, but the option is there for those who want to dig deeper.</p>
            <p>I hope future headlines give us real news with clear statistical breakdowns rather than vague wording like "missing" that raises more questions than it answers.</p>
            <p>So, as consumers of news, are we responding to verified data and context, or to a single emotionally loaded word? That is what we need to decide.</p>
